# KAM-Net: Synergizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Mamba for Efficient Image Dehazing

This repository contains the implementation code for the paper: **"KAM-Net: Synergizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Mamba for Efficient Image Dehazing"** (submitted to *Electronics*).

## 📢 News
- **[2025-12]**: The paper is currently under review.
- **[Update]**: Core model architecture code has been uploaded.

## 🚧 Code Availability

**Please Note:**
Currently, this repository contains **partial implementation** (mainly the core model files and essential modules) to support the peer review process.

**The full source code** (including data loading, training scripts, and pretrained weights) **will be fully released and updated immediately upon the acceptance of the paper.**

We are organizing and cleaning the code to ensure it is easy to use and reproduce.

## 🚀 Introduction
KAM-Net is a novel image dehazing architecture that integrates **Mamba (SSM)** with **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)** to achieve efficient, high-performance dehazing, particularly optimized for mobile and edge devices.

## 🛠️ Requirements (Preview)
- Python >= 3.8
- PyTorch >= 1.13
- CUDA >= 11.7
- `causal-conv1d` and `mamba-ssm`
